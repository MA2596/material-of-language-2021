    "For the first assignment, I wanted to work with \"My Mother\" by Frieda Hughes as the main body text. Frieda Hughes, poet and painter, is the daughter of Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes. Sylvia dided by suicide when Freida was three and became a frequent subject for literary analysis and media depictions. Ted died in 1998, and Frieda's older brother, Nicholas Hughes, died by suicide in 2009.\n",
    "\n",
    "The poem was written in response to the production of \"Sylvia\" in 2003, voicing a daughter's disdain for towards the media's needs to romanticse private tragedies on public screens.\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose this poem because there is an interesting emphasis on the passage (but also) looping of time, as Frieda have to watch her mom die again and again on screen. I had an idea of repeating the words, so that when time-related words such as \"again\" or \"annually\" appears, it will be repeated to express the length of time (so 'daily\" would be repeated ... 365 times? and at the end of the poem, \"forever\" would be looped forever, never letting the poem fully finish). The concept is not very obvious in this sketchbook, since I mostly worked on trying to isolate words like \"die\" or time-related keywords, but I really like the idea and will revisit when I have a better grasp of Python. For the first assignment, I wanted to warm myself up to Python and mostly poked around with different commands. It's not as bad as I think, since it's similar to what we learned in ICM ... but also vastly different."
